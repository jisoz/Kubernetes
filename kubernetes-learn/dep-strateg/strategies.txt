a deployment strategie is a way to change or upgrade the application , the aim is to make the change without downntime 

deployment strategies automaate the whole updating process as you can simply update the pod template or desired state ,
the deployment will alter the program state in background with actions like creating new pods , allocating more resources until the updated desired state is met 


types:
1-rolling update deployment
2-recreate deployment
3-canary deployment

rolling update deployment: DEFAULT  it replaces pods one by one of previous version of your app with pods of new version without any cluster downtime 
recreate deployment:shuts down all old pods and replaces them with new organise
canary deployment : partial update process allows you to test new program version  on a real userbase without commitement to full rollout 

in canary update startegie the dep create few new pods while keeping most pods on previous version ,
most users still use old vesion but small subset use new version act like testers 
if no bugs detected from this subset we can scale up the updated replicaset to produce full rollout 
if bug detected we can e asly rollback the few updated pods until bug fixed
